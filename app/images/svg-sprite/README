Using grunt-svgstore, any SVGs place in this folder will be combined into
../sprite.svg. Using grunt-processhtml, sprite.svg will be embedded into
our index.html. The SVG's can then be used in the html using the <use> tag,
for example:

<svg>
  <use xlink:href="#Svg-ID" />
</svg>

This system is described here:
https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/

Please Note:
When adding your first SVGs to the folder, the watcher probably will not
automatically pick them up. This is a known issue:
https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/issues/282

In that case, you will need to restart your 'grunt serve' process, or
manually run 'grunt svgstore'. After the first SVGs are picked up, the
watcher will work as expected.
