Using Grunt and css-sprite, any PNGs put in this folder will automatically be
combined into a ../sprite.png and a corresponding styles/_sprite.scss file
will be created/updated.

Please Note:
When adding your first PNGs to the folder, the watcher probably will not
automatically pick them up. This is a known issue:
https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/issues/282

In that case, you will need to restart your 'grunt serve' process, or
manually run 'grunt css_sprite'. After the first PNGs are picked up, the
watcher will work as expected.
